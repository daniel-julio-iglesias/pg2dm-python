Further Explorations in Classification

This chapter examines several other algorithms for classification including kNN and naïve Bayes. We look at the power of adding more data.
Contents

    Evaluating classifiers: training sets and test data
    10-fold cross validation
    Which is better: adding more data or improving the algorithm?
    the kNN algorithm
    Python implementation of kNN
