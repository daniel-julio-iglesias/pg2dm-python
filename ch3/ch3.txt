Implicit Ratings and Item Based Filtering

This chapter starts with a discussion of the types of user ratings we can use. Users can explicitly give ratings (thumbs up, thumbs down, 5 stars, or whatever) or they can rate products implicitly–if they buy an mp3 from Amazon, we can view that purchase as a ‘like’ rating.
